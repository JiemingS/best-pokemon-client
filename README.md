Best-Pokemon is a React application which helps user to get the Pokemons' Data.
Once signed up/in, user can:

2. Get the list of all the pokemons and can get the detail information about each pokemon.
3. Create their own pokmemons which the data(properties) whatever they want.
4. Can see all the DIY pokemons created by different user account.

## Thought Process & Execution

*   Planning: Initially I planned out the user stories and wireframes to maximize efficiency for users and ease of navigation.

*   CRUD Actions to Back-end: After setting up the necessary files and forms, I tested each feature with API requests(use postman).

*   Debug: I approached this project with a mindset of constantly making small changes and immediately testing those changes.

## Unsolved Problems / Future Iterations
can add some animations when the component of react is rendering
